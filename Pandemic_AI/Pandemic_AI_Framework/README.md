# Pandemic AI framework improvements
- [x] Create a performance - measuring project, so as to measure the upcoming improvements
- [x] Completely remove reflection - based comparison, to improve performance
- [x] Simplify the game - actions' class hierarchy, use interfaces instead, where possible
- [x] Create a method that generates the game's default definition, without the need for loading data from text
- [x] Implement an intermediate game state serialization class, to ease the transformation of the framework without losing ability to deserialize existing data
