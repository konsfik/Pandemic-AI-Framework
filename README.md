# Pandemic AI framework
Î‘ game playing AI framework for the board game Pandemic.

## Brief Game Description:
Pandemic is a cooperative board game, designed by Matt Leacock and first published by Z-Man Games in the United states in 2008.
The players' pawns are placed on the world map, in a situation where four deadly diseases have appeared and are spreading. During the game play, various random events, such as infections and outbreaks occur at new locations. The players can move on the map and attempt to prevent or correct these dangerous situations. In that process they may choose to "sacrifice" some of their cards in order to enhance their mobility. However, at the same time, the group must collaborate in gathering enough player cards to actually cure the four diseases, which is the game's ultimate goal. If the players do not manage to cure the diseases soon enough and the player cards run out, or if a high number of infections or outbreaks occurs, then the game is lost

## About the framework:
