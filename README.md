# Pandemic AI framework
a game playing AI framework for the board game Pandemic

This framework was developed as part of my thesis for the MSc in digital games, of the Institute of Digital Games (IDG), University of Malta, under the supervision of dr. Antonios Liapis.

It is being offered publicly so that other researchers may study the proposed AI techniques or develop their own.

## Technical requirements
The project is coded in c# and developed in visual studio.
