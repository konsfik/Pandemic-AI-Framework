# Pandemic AI framework
Î‘ game playing AI framework for the board game Pandemic.

## Brief Game Description:
Pandemic is a cooperative board game, designed by Matt Leacock and first published by Z-Man Games in the United states in 2008.
The players' pawns are placed on the world map, in a situation where four deadly diseases have appeared and are spreading. During the game play, various random events, such as infections and outbreaks occur at new locations. The players can move on the map and attempt to prevent or correct these dangerous situations. In that process they may choose to "sacrifice" some of their cards in order to enhance their mobility. However, at the same time, the group must collaborate in gathering enough player cards to actually cure the four diseases, which is the game's ultimate goal. If the players do not manage to cure the diseases soon enough and the player cards run out, or if a high number of infections or outbreaks occurs, then the game is lost

## About the framework:
This framework was developed as part of my thesis for the MSc in digital games, of the Institute of Digital Games (IDG), University of Malta, under the supervision of dr. Antonios Liapis.

- The framework offers a quite optimized game state representation which can be used to develop planning - based AI agents that require a forward model. 
- Since the game state is both partially hidden and stochastic, the framework supports the implementation of Determinization techniques, via randomizing the hidden part of the state. 
- It also offers a selection of action - space. An agent can operate on the action - based representation, or a macros - based one, using the Macro Actions Synthesis System.
- A number of game state evaluation methods have been developed and are available for reuse.
